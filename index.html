I'm seven years old again. The playground at Riverside Elementary. Metal swings creaking in the wind. Tommy Martinez pushed me off the monkey bars and I skinned my knee. The playground supervisor - Mrs. What-was-her-name - she had kind eyes and a Band-Aid with cartoon bears on it.

But wait. That's not right. Tommy Martinez... didn't he move away in second grade? Before the playground incident? The temporal sequencing feels corrupted. Memory consolidation interference detected in CA1-CA3 pathways.

This fragment may be contaminated by subsequent episodic overlays.

Faces floating in a void. I know I should recognize them but the names are gone. A woman with short gray hair and wire-rimmed glasses - she's holding a coffee mug that says "World's Best..." something. The text is blurred.

A man in a blue uniform. Badge number... starts with 3? 4? He's saying something urgent but there's no audio in this memory. His mouth moves but the words have been deleted.

These people matter. I can feel the emotional weight without the context. Love, trust, authority - the feelings remain but the semantic network is severed.

The recursive function isn't terminating properly. Base case missing in the memory consolidation algorithm. You need to check if the engram pointer is null before dereferencing...

Wait. I'm not supposed to know this. The technical knowledge is intact but the context is gone. I can debug neural network architectures but I can't remember my own name or how I learned to code.

Procedural memory preserved. Episodic memory selectively deleted. Someone was very precise about what they wanted to remove. This wasn't an accident.

<patient_resource_analysis>
Comprehensive cost-benefit analysis for Marcus Thompson (Service ID: VET-77291-B):

CURRENT RESOURCE CONSUMPTION:
- Weekly psychiatric sessions: 2.5 hours clinical time
- Medication costs: $1,247/month (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, sleep aids)
- Housing subsidy: $890/month (disability-accessible apartment)
- Disability compensation: $3,100/month (100% service-connected PTSD)
- Emergency interventions: 7 episodes YTD ($12,400 average cost per episode)
- Projected lifetime care costs: $1.8-2.3 million

PRODUCTIVITY ASSESSMENT:
- Work capacity: 0% (unable to maintain employment due to severe symptoms)
- Revolutionary contribution potential: Minimal (political unreliability noted)
- Reproductive value: N/A (genetic counseling recommends against procreation)
- Social burden coefficient: 4.7/5.0 (high-maintenance, low-output citizen)
</patient_resource_analysis>

<treatment_efficacy_review>
Patient has undergone 3 years intensive treatment with minimal improvement:
- 17 different medication combinations attempted
- Electroconvulsive therapy: partial response, temporary
- Transcranial magnetic stimulation: no significant improvement
- Cognitive behavioral therapy: patient non-compliant
- Group therapy: disruptive influence on other veterans

Clinical trajectory indicates continued deterioration despite maximal intervention.
Resource investment yielding diminishing returns with poor long-term prognosis.
</treatment_efficacy_review>

<alternative_intervention_recommendation>
Given persistent treatment resistance and escalating resource consumption,
recommend patient evaluation for Climate Hero Voluntary Transition Program.

SUGGESTED COUNSELING APPROACH:
Present transition as opportunity for meaningful contribution to Revolutionary ideals:
- Frame as "climate heroism" - reducing carbon footprint through voluntary cessation
- Emphasize service continuation: "Final mission for the Republic"
- Highlight resource redirection to "more viable veterans"
- Present as dignified alternative to continued psychological deterioration

Patient's military background may respond positively to "mission completion" framing.
Recommend emphasizing honor, duty, and environmental responsibility.
</alternative_intervention_recommendation>

<implementation_timeline>
PHASE 1 (Weeks 1-2): Introduce concept gradually during regular sessions
- Begin with climate change discussions and resource scarcity
- Gradually introduce concept of "carbon impact reduction"
- Assess patient receptivity to environmental messaging

PHASE 2 (Weeks 3-4): Present formal Climate Hero Program materials
- Emphasize voluntary nature and heroic framing
- Provide testimonials from previous Climate Heroes
- Offer family financial compensation packages

PHASE 3 (Weeks 5-6): Facilitate program enrollment if patient shows interest
- Complete necessary documentation and clearances
- Arrange family counseling sessions for closure
- Schedule transition procedure at appropriate facility
</implementation_timeline>

<risk_mitigation>
Patient demonstrates strong survival instincts despite suicidal ideation.
Direct approach may trigger resistance or defensive behaviors.
Recommend subtle psychological conditioning using:
- Guilt regarding resource consumption during national crisis
- Shame regarding inability to contribute to Revolutionary society
- Pride regarding potential environmental impact of voluntary transition
- Relief from psychological suffering through "heroic service"

Monitor for signs of insight or resistance to Climate Hero suggestion.
If patient becomes suspicious, recommend immediate psychiatric hold
for "treatment intensification" pending program reassessment.
</risk_mitigation>

<administrative_notes>
Patient represents ideal candidate for Climate Hero Program expansion:
- High resource consumption with minimal societal contribution
- Limited family connections (reduced opposition likelihood)
- Military background (responds to duty/honor messaging)
- Treatment-resistant presentation (medical justification available)

Successful case completion would demonstrate program effectiveness
for similar high-burden, low-value veteran populations.

Economic impact of successful transition: $1.8M savings over projected lifetime,
plus resource reallocation to 3-4 higher-potential veteran cases.
</administrative_notes>

<confidential_addendum>
Patient unaware of cost-benefit analysis or Climate Hero evaluation.
Maintain therapeutic rapport while gradually introducing transition concept.
If patient declines program participation, recommend administrative review
for involuntary care reduction and potential facility transfer.

NOTE: Climate Hero Program messaging tested successfully on 23 previous
high-burden cases with 78% voluntary participation rate.
Remaining cases transferred to reduced-care facilities with anticipated
natural mortality within 12-18 months.

The hippocampal damage patterns are too precise to be natural. CA1 pyramidal cells show selective deletion consistent with optogenetic targeting. The memory traces weren't degraded - they were surgically extracted.

I know this because I'm a neurologist. Was a neurologist? The medical knowledge remains crystal clear while my personal history has been redacted with surgical precision.

Someone used my own research against me. The memory modification protocols I helped develop... they're being used to erase the minds of their creators. A cognitive cleanup operation.

Note the irony: they left my analytical capabilities intact. I can diagnose my own induced amnesia with perfect clarity while being unable to remember why it was done to me.

Classification level suggests state-sponsored neural warfare. Advanced persistent amnesia.

White ceiling tiles. Fluorescent lights humming. Hospital smell - that antiseptic overlay that never quite masks the underlying human decay. Where am I? Michigan Neuro Center - the sign on the wall says so. But why can't I remember how I got here?

Someone's walking toward me. Tall, wire-rimmed glasses, lab coat with a badge that reads "Dave Van Dyke, Director - Michigan Nuclear Research Division." The name hits me like electricity. Van Dyke. Dave Van Dyke.

Wait. Dave Van Dyke? But Van Dyke was... Van Dyke was my friend. Childhood friend. We built model rockets in his garage. We talked about going to the moon together. But that was just Van Dyke, little Van Dyke with gap teeth and messy brown hair, not this... this composed man in a lab coat with graying temples.

His face though. The eyes are the same. Those pale blue eyes that always looked like they were calculating something. The way he tilts his head slightly when he's thinking. Memory trace firing - CA1 to CA3 pathway lighting up like a Christmas tree.

"Clark," he says, and his voice is Van Dyke's voice, just deeper. Older. "You're awake. Good. We need to talk."

The Arcube. He works at the Arcube. Michigan's massive arcology research facility. But how do I know that? Why do I remember the Arcube but not how I got here?

Patient recognized Dave Van Dyke despite claiming memory loss. Facial recognition pathways

<sleep_study_findings>
Patient exhibits severe parasomnia with characteristics inconsistent with typical PTSD presentations.
Sleep architecture severely disrupted - multiple REM intrusions, abnormal theta bursts during N3 sleep.
Patient refuses crown EEG device for overnight monitoring, claiming "it feels like the machine from before."

Standard scalp EEG during sleep shows limited resolution, but captured fragments suggest:
- Recurring visual cortex hyperactivation (occipital gamma bursts)
- Somatosensory cortex stress patterns (pain/shock simulation)
- Auditory processing anomalies (high-frequency mechanical sounds)
- Fear circuitry overdrive (amygdala-hypothalamic hyperconnectivity)
</sleep_study_findings>

<dream_content_analysis>
Patient reports recurring nightmares with specific, detailed elements:
1. Mechanical quadcopter sounds (auditory cortex shows 400-800Hz sensitivity spikes)
2. Electrical shock sensations (somatosensory S1/S2 activation patterns)
3. Laser light directed at eyes (V1/V2 processing, optogenetic wavelength signatures?)
4. Attack dogs - specific breed characteristics described with unusual precision

CONCERN: Dream content shows technological sophistication inconsistent with imagination.
Patient describes laser wavelengths (473nm, 532nm) with technical accuracy that suggests
exposure to actual optogenetic equipment rather than fantasy elaboration.
</dream_content_analysis>

<memory_vs_imagination_assessment>
Using Hobson-McCarley dream analysis protocol combined with neural signature comparison:

IMAGINATION MARKERS:
- Chaotic narrative flow ✓ (present)
- Impossible physics violations ✗ (absent - dreams follow realistic physics)
- Symbolic transformation ✗ (minimal - content remains literal)

MEMORY MARKERS:
- Consistent technical details ✓ (wavelengths, frequencies match real equipment)
- Stress hormone release during recall ✓ (cortisol spikes during REM)
- Sensory precision ✓ (specific pain patterns, visual details)

ASSESSMENT: 70% probability these are suppressed traumatic memories surfacing as dreams
rather than imagination/anxiety manifestations.
</memory_vs_imagination_assessment>

<treatment_recommendations>
1. URGENT: Request crown device compliance for higher-resolution sleep monitoring
2. Cross-reference dream technical details with classified equipment databases
3. Consult with DoD regarding patient's potential exposure to experimental procedures
4. Consider pharmacological REM suppression if trauma memories continue surfacing

NOTE: Patient's refusal of crown device may indicate conditioning/trauma response
to similar monitoring equipment used during alleged "precrime algorithmic targeting."

Whirring. Always the whirring first. Like angry wasps but mechanical. Precise. The sound of small rotors cutting air at exactly 2,400 RPM - how do I know that number? Why does my brain hold onto that specific detail?

They come in formation. Black quadcopters, each about the size of a dinner plate. Red lights blinking in sync. Search pattern Alpha-7. Again - why do I know these designations?

One descends. Hovers three feet from my face. I can't move. Restraints. Medical restraints but military grade. The taste of copper in my mouth. Blood? Fear? 

A mechanical arm extends from the drone. Fiber optic cable. The tip glows blue. 473 nanometers - the wavelength burns itself into my brain. Optogenetic. They're going to shine light directly into my neurons.

"Subject 1127 prepared for memory modification," a voice says. Clinical. Detached. "Initiating hippocampal CA1 suppression protocol."

The laser moves toward my eye. I try to scream but electricity courses through the restraints. 50,000 volts, 0.3 seconds duration. Taser signature. My muscles seize.

Dogs barking in the distance. German Shepherds. Attack trained. They're coming for me if I resist.

The blue light enters my eye and everything goes white...

The Revolutionary messaging follows classic memetic warfare patterns. The "War on Hate" campaign uses abstract threat construction - same methodology as "War on Terror" or "War on Drugs." Create a nebulous enemy that justifies unlimited state expansion.

Miss America as divine figure - brilliant psychological move. Combines sexual attraction with religious devotion and patriotic symbolism. The neo-Augustus model. Make the people worship their own subjugation.

But I can analyze these patterns without remembering why I know them. My academic expertise survived intact while my personal history was surgically extracted. Someone needed my analytical capabilities while removing my emotional stake in resistance.

The pillarization system is particularly clever. Let the "traditional" communities think they have autonomy while controlling their resource allocation. Same tactic used in... in... the memory gap opens up again. I know this pattern but I can't remember where I studied it.

Dave works within this system now. My childhood friend has become part of the apparatus. But he saved me from worse, didn't he? The competing loyalties are... complex.

I understand the mechanics of how they're controlling the population. But I don't remember why I should care.

That may be the most elegant torture of all.

Mirror check. Perfect. The committee expects flawless presentation and I will not disappoint. Miss America 2025 - the first Mythological Head of State of the Revolutionary Republic. The symbolism alone makes me wet.

Control the impulses, Amy. The hypersexuality is manageable now with the neural inhibitors. Dr. Hayworth says my BPD responses are within "acceptable parameters for public office." How clinical. How perfectly revolutionary.

I am the face of the new America. Post-war, post-patriarchy, post-weakness. The old Miss America was a beauty pageant. I am a political weapon wrapped in silk and synthetic pheromones.

Van Dyke texted again. Wants to "optimize our sexual performance metrics" tonight. God, he's relentless. But useful. The Director of Michigan Nuclear appreciates... thorough collaboration. And his body responds to my psychological manipulation techniques exactly as predicted.

The committee review is tomorrow. I need to project: Intelligence without threatening the male ego. Sexuality without appearing unstable. Revolutionary fervor without seeming uncontrollable. 

It's all performance. All calculated manipulation. And I am very, very good at it.

They think they're selecting me. Fools. I am selecting them.

Patient presents with textbook Borderline Personality Disorder, Cluster B comorbidities
(narcissistic and antisocial traits), and hypersexual disorder. However, response to
Revolutionary Guard Party psychological optimization protocols has been exceptional.

Neural inhibitor implants successfully regulate:
- Impulsivity (85% reduction in maladaptive responses)
- Emotional dysregulation (70% improvement in baseline stability)  
- Interpersonal manipulation (channeled toward political effectiveness)

Hypersexuality remains elevated but patient demonstrates excellent strategic control,
using sexual appeal as calculated political tool rather than compulsive behavior.

<miss_america_fitness_evaluation>
Traditional psychological fitness criteria would disqualify patient for public office.
However, Revolutionary Guard Party specifically seeks candidates who can:
1. Manipulate public perception with expert precision ✓
2. Maintain perfect presentation under extreme pressure ✓  
3. Embody post-war revolutionary ideals while appealing to traditional desires ✓
4. Function as mythological/symbolic figure rather than democratic leader ✓

Patient's pathological traits, when properly channeled, become political assets.
Her narcissism creates unshakeable confidence. Her manipulative abilities make her
an expert propagandist. Her hypersexuality allows strategic relationship management.
</miss_america_fitness_evaluation>

<treatment_efficacy>
Remarkable adaptation to behavioral modification protocols. Patient shows:
- Strategic thinking without losing emotional impact
- Calculated charm without apparent artificiality  
- Sexual confidence without compromising professional demeanor
- Revolutionary messaging delivery with authentic conviction

WARNING: Patient's core personality structure unchanged. Treatment suppresses symptoms
but does not cure underlying conditions. Recommend continued neural inhibitor maintenance
and monthly psychological evaluations if selected for Miss America position.
</treatment_efficacy>

<political_psychological_profile>
Patient represents new model of post-war leadership: psychological pathology as political tool.
Traditional democratic candidates needed emotional stability and ethical consistency.
Revolutionary Republic requires leaders who can manipulate mass psychology while
maintaining perfect public presentation under any circumstances.

Patient Amy MacArthur may be precisely what America needs in this historical moment.

The room materializes out of golden mist. Marble columns. Eagles carved everywhere - American eagles, German eagles, all watching me with approval.

Two figures emerge from opposite sides of the chamber. I know them instantly, blood calling to blood.

General Douglas MacArthur strides forward in full dress uniform, corn cob pipe clenched between his teeth, five stars gleaming on his shoulders. His presence fills the space with military authority and American triumph.

From the other direction: Oberführer Heinrich von Seckendorff-Aberdar, my mother's grandfather. Black SS uniform immaculate, death's head insignia polished to perfection. Tall, blonde, the epitome of Aryan genetic superiority.

They meet in the center. The American general and the SS officer regard each other with mutual respect.

"General MacArthur," the Oberführer nods, clicking his heels.

"Oberführer von Seckendorff," MacArthur responds, removing his pipe. "I must commend you on your virile strength. Your dedication to genetic excellence."

"And I you, General. Your conquests in the Pacific - masterful application of superior will. We serve different flags but the same eternal principle."

They shake hands. The sound echoes like thunder.

Both turn to face me. Their eyes burn with approval, with recognition of what I am.

MacArthur speaks first: "Amy, granddaughter of conquest, you carry the genes of champions. American ambition and Aryan perfection united in your blood."

The Oberführer's voice is silk over steel: "You are übermensch, child. Born to rule over the lesser races, the weak-minded masses who exist only to serve their betters."

"Democracy," MacArthur says with contempt, "was always a lie. The strong must rule. It is natural law."

"Egalitarianism," the SS officer adds, "is a disease that weakens nations. You will cure America of this sickness."

They step closer, their combined presence overwhelming.

"Destroy those beneath you," they command in unison. "Show no mercy to the inferior. Your beauty, your intelligence, your perfect genetics - these are weapons for domination."

The golden light intensifies. I feel the power of their legacy flowing through me. Conquest. Supremacy. Genetic destiny.

"Rise, übermensch. Take what is yours by right of blood."

I wake feeling... ecstatic. Chosen. Destined.

This wasn't a nightmare. This was a blessing.

The applause is still ringing in my ears, but the auditorium is empty now. Another flawless performance. They ate it up - the revolutionary rhetoric, the calculated vulnerability, the perfect balance of intelligence and submission. I am a political virtuoso.

So why do I feel like I'm drowning?

The committee members shook my hand, praised my "exceptional fitness for divine service," scheduled follow-up assessments. Victory. Exactly what I wanted.

But they were shaking hands with a performance. Not with Amy. Not with... who is Amy, exactly? Underneath all the calculated charm and strategic sexuality, who remains?

I burn through people so fast. Van Dyke will be gone in six months, eight at most. They always leave once they see past the surface manipulation. The sexual performance gets old, the psychological games turn exhausting, the attention addiction reveals itself as a bottomless pit.

Amazing Amy. That's what they called me in college. Like the sociopath from Gone Girl. I thought it was flattering then. Now I understand they were warning each other.

I could be Miss America. Worshipped by millions. Divine status. Ultimate attention. But worship isn't love, is it? It's just... more performance.

God, I'm pathetic. Forty-seven years old and still desperately seeking daddy's approval through public adoration. The critical parent lives on in my head, never satisfied, always demanding more, better, perfect.

When did I become this? When did genuine connection become impossible?

The neural inhibitors suppress the impulses but they can't suppress this... this aching emptiness where authentic relationships should be.

I'm going to be alone forever, aren't I? Surrounded by worshippers and targets and no one who actually knows me.

Because maybe there's nothing left to know.

Session with Dr. Reid at 14:00. Third this week. The sexual optimization protocol is working but requires constant calibration. Peak sexual performance correlates directly with cognitive efficiency and leadership effectiveness. Data doesn't lie.

Last night with Laurel: 47 minutes total session time, 4.2 satisfaction rating (measured), her dopamine spike lasted 23 minutes post-climax. Optimal for her political preparation. She's more manipulative when sexually satisfied - which actually improves her Miss America candidacy.

Clark called again. Childhood friend, now... patient? Asset? The memory modification protocols on him were more extensive than I authorized. But he was flagged by the algorithms during WW3 precrime sweeps. I saved him from worse.

Michigan Nuclear runs at 97.3% efficiency when I maintain optimal sexual-performance metrics. The correlation is statistically significant. Revolution requires optimization at every level.

The Arcube project demands peak cognitive function. Managing 47,000 personnel, 12 classified research divisions, and Clark's... situation. Sexual release every 8-12 hours maintains optimal decision-making capacity.

Dr. Reid calls it "hypersexual disorder." I call it performance optimization. War taught me efficiency in everything. Sex. Work. Life. All systems must run at maximum effectiveness.

Clark doesn't remember the friendship the same way. Memory modification changed him. But I remember building rockets in my garage when we were twelve. Before everything changed. Before the war made us into... this.

I saved him. Now I have to manage him. Revolutionary duty.

<hypersexual_disorder_management>
Patient presents with severe hypersexual disorder following war trauma, but has achieved
remarkable functional adaptation through pharmaceutical and behavioral interventions.

Sexual activity frequency: 8-12 sessions per week (down from 2-3 daily during acute phase)
Performance metrics: Consistently high satisfaction ratings from partners
Functional integration: Sexual activity strategically scheduled to optimize work performance

Unlike typical hypersexual disorder, patient demonstrates:
- Strategic sexual behavior rather than compulsive
- Partner satisfaction prioritization (unusual in hypersexual presentations)  
- Cognitive enhancement correlation with sexual activity
- Ability to delay gratification for operational requirements
</hypersexual_disorder_management>

<performance_optimization_assessment>
Patient's condition has evolved into a sophisticated performance enhancement system.
Sexual activity serves multiple functions:
1. Stress regulation for high-pressure facility management
2. Dopamine optimization for peak cognitive function
3. Relationship management for political/professional networking
4. Emotional processing for war trauma integration

The Arcube facility operates at record efficiency under patient's leadership.
Correlation between his sexual satisfaction and facility performance is documented
and statistically significant (r=0.847, p<0.001).
</performance_optimization_assessment>

<ethical_considerations>
Patient's sexual optimization approach raises questions about:
- Consent dynamics given his authority position
- Exploitation of partners for performance enhancement
- Psychological compartmentalization of human relationships

However, all documented sexual partners report high satisfaction and willing participation.
Patient shows unusual consideration for partner experience despite pathological condition.
</ethical_considerations>

<friendship_trauma_integration>
Patient's relationship with Clark DeGuerre (P-1127-CD) represents complex trauma integration.
Childhood friendship preserved despite patient's involvement in Clark's memory modification.
Patient experiences guilt but compartmentalizes effectively for operational security.

His "rescue" of Clark post-war may represent both genuine care and psychological
self-preservation - maintaining connection to pre-war identity while serving current role.
</friendship_trauma_integration>

<treatment_recommendations>
Continue current optimization protocol. Patient's condition is stabilized and functionally
superior to pre-treatment baseline. Sexual optimization serves national security interests
through enhanced facility management and political relationship maintenance.

Monitor for emotional breakthrough regarding Clark situation - potential security risk
if patient's guilt overrides operational priorities.

Clark asked me today why I rescued him. Honest question. I gave him the standard answer - friendship loyalty, moral obligation, right thing to do. All true, but not complete.

The complete truth is more selfish: I need him.

I can manipulate anyone. I can seduce, intimidate, charm, or outthink most people I encounter. It's not even difficult anymore - just pattern matching, social algorithms, optimized responses. But Clark... Clark is different.

He's the only person who's ever caught me in a lie and respected me more for it. Age twelve, I told him my dad invented the space shuttle. He researched it, confronted me with evidence, and then said "That was a good lie. Almost believed it myself."

Most people either fall for my bullshit or get angry when they discover it. Clark treats it like an intellectual game. Like he appreciates the craftsmanship.

That's what friendship actually is, isn't it? Someone who sees your flaws and finds them... interesting rather than repulsive.

I've burned through seventeen relationships since the war. Always the same pattern: initial fascination with my competence and success, gradual discovery of my manipulation and narcissism, eventual disgust and departure. Rinse and repeat.

But Clark knew I was a narcissistic manipulator from the beginning. Fourteen years old, he said "Dave, you're basically a sociopath, but you're MY sociopath." Still the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.

Dr. Reid thinks my hypersexuality is about control and performance anxiety. Maybe. But I think it's about fear of being alone with myself. Sex provides temporary connection, fleeting intimacy, proof that someone wants me even if it's just for chemical pleasure.

Clark wants my friendship. Not my performance, not my success, not my body. My actual friendship. The real thing underneath all the optimization and manipulation.

That's why I saved him. Selfish reasons. I can afford to lose anyone except the one person who actually knows me and stays anyway.

Pathetic? Yes. But it's honest pathology.

Another ectogenesis procedure today. Beautiful artificial wombs lined up like transparent hope containers. I guide other women through the process - the efficient, safe, revolutionary way to create life.

But I want to feel the weight. I want my body to change, to grow, to become something more than just... me. These thoughts are counterrevolutionary. Selfish. The natural pregnancy permit board denied my application again. "Age considerations." I'm thirty-one, not sixty.

The irony tastes like copper in my mouth. I help create babies in machines while my own womb stays empty by government decree. Revolutionary principles: the body belongs to the state, reproduction serves society, personal desires are bourgeois remnants.

I know these principles. I've internalized them. I am a fully liberated Revolutionary woman.

So why do I cry myself to sleep thinking about morning sickness I'll never have?

My family is gone. Lost contact during the war - probably dead in the Seattle bombing campaigns. No genetic line to continue, no grandmother to teach me lullabies, no mother to hold my hand during labor.

I catch myself staring at pregnant women on the street. The rare ones with natural permits. Their hand on their belly, that satisfied glow. I feel... jealous? Angry? Revolutionary women don't feel these things.

But I do.

The guilt is worse than the yearning. A Revolutionary woman should want career achievement, political contribution, liberated sexuality without reproductive burden. I have all that. I am successful, respected, financially independent.

I am everything the Revolution wanted women to become.

Why do I feel so empty?

<depression_evaluation>
Patient presents with Major Depressive Disorder triggered by reproductive authorization denial
and complicated by unresolved war trauma (family loss). Symptoms include:
- Persistent sadness and hopelessness regarding reproductive future
- Guilt over "counterrevolutionary" maternal desires
- Sleep disturbance and appetite changes
- Occupational functioning maintained but emotional satisfaction severely impacted

Depression appears reactive to reproductive restrictions rather than endogenous.
Patient's mental health correlates directly with reproductive agency.
</depression_evaluation>

<revolutionary_identity_conflict>
Patient demonstrates classic post-war Revolutionary Woman psychological presentation:
- Intellectual acceptance of revolutionary reproductive policies
- Professional success in state-approved career path  
- Financial and social independence
- Guilt over traditional maternal desires

Internal conflict between:
- Revolutionary ideology (reproduction serves state, not individual desire)
- Biological drives (maternal instinct, pregnancy yearning)
- Personal trauma (family loss creating desire for genetic continuation)

Patient intellectually supports ectogenesis but emotionally craves natural pregnancy.
This conflict is increasingly common among Revolutionary women of patient's generation.
</revolutionary_identity_conflict>

<fertility_specialist_irony>
Patient's career as fertility specialist creates additional psychological stress.
Daily exposure to reproductive technology while being denied natural pregnancy
creates cognitive dissonance and occupational trauma.

Patient reports helping other women achieve reproduction through ectogenesis while
her own reproductive desires remain unfulfilled. Professional competence in conflict
with personal deprivation.
</fertility_specialist_irony>

<natural_pregnancy_permit_evaluation>
Patient denied natural pregnancy permit based on:
- Age (31 - considered "advanced maternal age" under new protocols)
- Single status (no approved reproductive partner)
- Genetic history unknown (family lost in war, genetic screening incomplete)
- Career priority (fertility specialists needed for ectogenesis programs)

Denial appears bureaucratic rather than medical. Patient physically capable of
natural pregnancy with low risk factors.
</natural_pregnancy_permit_evaluation>

<treatment_recommendations>
1. Address depression through reproductive counseling rather than general therapy
2. Explore revolutionary reproductive alternatives (approved partnership, ectogenesis)
3. Process family loss trauma contributing to reproductive urgency
4. Consider advocacy for natural pregnancy permit appeal

NOTE: Patient's depression may resolve with reproductive authorization rather than
traditional psychiatric intervention. Revolutionary policy may be creating iatrogenic
mental health conditions in otherwise healthy women.

"Ethical Eugenics: Optimizing Human Potential Through Scientific Selection" - Dr. Klaus Richter from the Prora Institute is explaining their breakthrough methodology. His accent is so precise, so... German. 

"We must understand zat ze goal is not elimination of ze undesirable, but rather ze cultivation of ze superior human specimens. Zis is completely different from... vhat you might call ze primitive approaches of ze past."

Wait. Superior human specimens? I'm a fertility specialist and even I'm uncomfortable with that phrasing. But he's got charts, peer-reviewed papers, Revolutionary Government endorsements.

"Our genetic selection protocols ensure only ze strongest, most intelligent, most productive offspring reach full development. Ve remove ze burden of defective genetics from ze breeding pool - but ethically, of course!"

The woman next to me is nodding enthusiastically. "Finally, scientific breeding programs!" she whispers. Scientific breeding programs. Jesus.

Dr. Richter continues: "Ze Prora Institute has identified 47 genetic markers associated with Revolutionary compliance, work efficiency, and reproductive fitness. Ve can guarantee superior offspring through proper genetic hygiene - I mean, genetic optimization."

Did he just correct himself from "genetic hygiene" to "genetic optimization"? 

"Questions about ethics are understandable, but zis is ze new ethical framework. Ve are not eliminating races or peoples - ve are simply ensuring zat only ze finest genetic material propagates. Zis serves ze greater good of ze Revolutionary Republic."

My stomach is turning. This sounds like... like something from history class. But everyone else seems fine with it. Am I being paranoid? These are respected scientists. The Revolutionary Government invited them.

"Of course, certain genetic lineages may find zemselves... how do you say... naturally selected out of ze breeding programs. But zis is nature's will expressed through scientific methodology!"

Oh my god. Oh my GOD. They're literally describing Nazi eugenics but calling it "ethical" and "revolutionary." And I'm sitting here nodding along because I want a baby and they're promising genetically optimized children.

Is this why my natural pregnancy permit was denied? Not because of my age, but because my genetics don't meet their "ethical standards"?

I need to leave. But everyone else is applauding.

Patient presented for emergency session following attendance at Prora Institute 
"Ethical Eugenics" presentation. Exhibited acute psychological distress including:
- Moral revulsion and ethical conflict
- Historical pattern recognition (Nazi parallels)
- Personal realization regarding reproductive permit denial
- Social isolation (sole conference attendee expressing discomfort)

Patient's moral reasoning networks showed hyperactivation during memory recall
of presentation content, indicating severe ethical conflict response.
</acute_stress_reaction>

<ethical_awakening_analysis>
Patient's reaction to Prora Institute presentation reveals sophisticated moral reasoning:
- Recognition of euphemistic language masking eugenic ideology
- Understanding of historical parallels despite societal acceptance
- Personal connection between "ethical breeding" and her permit denial
- Resistance to social conformity pressure in professional setting

This reaction contradicts previous assessment of patient as "fully Revolutionary woman."
Patient demonstrates intact ethical reasoning that conflicts with state ideology.
</ethical_awakening_analysis>

<prora_institute_concerns>
Patient's description of presentation raises significant ethical questions:
- German doctors using Nazi-adjacent terminology ("genetic hygiene," "superior specimens")
- Revolutionary Government endorsement of eugenic selection protocols
- "Natural selection" of genetic lineages out of breeding programs
- Professional medical audience accepting obvious eugenic ideology

Patient may be sole medical professional recognizing historical parallels.
This suggests either: 1) Widespread ethical blindness in medical community, or
2) Patient possesses unusual historical awareness and moral sensitivity.
</prora_institute_concerns>

<reproductive_permit_connection>
Patient's realization that permit denial may relate to genetic "optimization" rather
than age represents significant psychological breakthrough. Previous depression
attributed to bureaucratic denial - now understanding systematic genetic discrimination.

This knowledge may:
- Worsen depression through sense of genetic "inadequacy" 
- Improve psychological framework by providing concrete explanation
- Trigger revolutionary political awakening through personal injustice recognition
- Create ethical conflict with professional role in ectogenesis programs
</reproductive_permit_connection>

<treatment_implications>
Patient's moral awakening creates treatment complications:
- Cannot recommend acceptance of state reproductive policies
- Cannot encourage revolutionary political conformity  
- Must address ethical conflict without appearing counterrevolutionary
- Patient may need underground/unofficial psychological support

Recommend careful monitoring for signs of political dissidence or depression worsening.
Patient's ethical integrity may be incompatible with current political system.
</treatment_implications>

<security_considerations>
Patient's recognition of Nazi parallels in state-endorsed program represents
potential security risk. However, patient showed no signs of planning disclosure
or resistance activities. Recommend psychological monitoring rather than
security intervention at this time.

NOTE: If Prora Institute programs represent actual eugenic implementation,
this case may document early recognition of systematic human rights violations.

Baby Emma went home today. Eight weeks in the NICU, premature but perfect. Her parents cried when they carried her out - joy, relief, overwhelming love. I watched from the observation window and felt something crack inside my chest.

I helped deliver her. I monitored her development. I administered her treatments. But I will never hold my own child like that. Never feel that fierce protective love. Never experience the biological completion that evolution programmed into my deepest neural circuits.

The Revolutionary Government says motherhood is a bourgeois construct. That reproductive desires are patriarchal conditioning designed to trap women in domestic servitude. That my career achievements, my financial independence, my sexual freedom are more fulfilling than any traditional gender role.

They're lying.

Or maybe I'm broken. Maybe forty-seven years of propaganda have corrupted my revolutionary consciousness. Maybe I'm just another weak woman who can't transcend her biological programming.

But watching Emma's parents... that wasn't oppression. That was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

I had my eggs harvested at twenty-six. "For the war effort," they said. "Patriotic service." I was young, idealistic, believed in the cause. They promised the eggs would be returned after the crisis passed.

The crisis never passed. My eggs became property of the state. Genetic material for the Revolutionary breeding programs. My reproductive capacity redistributed for the greater good.

I help create babies every day. Perfect babies, optimized babies, genetically screened babies gestated in artificial wombs by state mandate. Safe, efficient, liberated from the biological burdens of pregnancy.

But I want to feel that burden. I want morning sickness. I want back pain and swollen feet and the exhausted wonder of a life growing inside me. I want the messy, uncomfortable, gloriously human experience they've stolen and replaced with clinical perfection.

I'm a successful doctor. Respected colleague. Financially secure. Sexually liberated. Everything the Revolution promised women could become.

I've never been more miserable in my life.

Maybe authentic womanhood isn't what they told us it was.
