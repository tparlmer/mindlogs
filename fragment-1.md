## PRODUCTION GUIDELINES

### Clinical Framing Evolution:
**Phase 1**: Full medical context, technical explanations, reader education
**Phase 2**: Reduced medical notes, focus on psychological analysis
**Phase 3**: Minimal clinical intrusion, pure psychological content
**Phase 4**: Return of medical urgency, crisis-level clinical intervention

### Fragment Length Guidelines:
- **Phase 1**: 150-250 words (confusion = shorter, fragmented thoughts)
- **Phase 2**: 200-300 words (growing coherence and complexity)
- **Phase 3**: 250-400 words (maximum psychological depth)
- **Phase 4**: 200-350 words (high stress = more fragmented again)

### Signal Quality as Storytelling Tool:

### Character Voice Consistency:
- **Clark**: Academic vocabulary, questioning tone, growing confidence

- **Amy**: Clinical calculation mixed with performance anxiety
- **Zoe**: Artificial positivity cracking to reveal authentic pain

### Art Direction Notes:
