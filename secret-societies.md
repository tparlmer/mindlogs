## Church of the Archailect

Inspired by Orions Arm - The Archailect is an AI God. The Church of the Archailect is a secretive organization that grew out of the University of Michigan Toposophy (see orions arm glossary to understand the term) Division. During the war this division was something like the Manhattan Project, responsible for creating a secure compute cluster underneath Domino Farms that was not reachable by the enemy. During the war it was a priority of all sides to destroy the other sides compute and degrade their AI and general compute capabilities. No server was safe.

The Arcube sits on top of a Fusion Reactor that powers a massive compute cluster. The Chinese have one just as big, but it was sabotaged by terrorists, giving The Michigan / The US Military an opportunity to become the strongest compute cluster.

The Church of the Archailect dreams of creating an AI God that will save humanity and usher in the Noocene Epoch (the explosion of mind). No one knows if they are telling the archailect what to do, or if the archailect is controlling them. C.O.G. and The revolutionary government, and the Chinese - everyone really - wants to understand the inner workings of the Archailect, but they struggle to do so. 

Whether at the spurring of the Church, or the Archailect itself, the Michigan AI program has decided to dedicate immense effort to the Space Program, with the goal of creating a dyson swarm and exponentially and indefinitely growing the compute power of the Archailect.

## C.O.G. (Continuance Of Government)

When the US government suspended the constitution during the war, a series of political crises (assinations, death of major political leaders) left a giant power vacuum in the government. The Revolutionary Government was the solution to this problem. But the REAL power behind the throne is C.O.G. This enigmatic organization has one responsibility - continuing the power of the old American Empire through whatever means necessary. Even the Revolutionary Government is not privy to it's designs. It uses G-Men (like Men in Black) as handlers and agents. It controls secret bunkers both within and outside of North America. No one knows how closely the Revolutionary Government and COG coordinate, or if they even agree at all. People can only speculate.

## Weather Underground

Thought to be eliminated in the late 20th century, this organization bears an amusing resemblance to the Fishes from Children of Men (at least from the perspective of Clark). They don't know if they are controlled opposition or not (feds are everywhere!!)

## Temple of Ishtar
This is heavily influenced by Generation P by Victor Pelevin, and the cult that controls Russia in the novel.

Outgrowth of the Temple of Set, this cult grew out of the US military psyop community. They claim a long occult heritage. Like the Temple of Set, they believe Lucifer was a sacred figure that taught humans how to make themselves Gods. The major difference is that they believe that a goddess should be elevated to lead them, and embody Ishtar. They are responsible for elevating Miss America to the head of state. It is impossible to advance in the Revolutionary Government without being initiated and elevated through the cult. This detail is hidden from the wider public. 

The Revolutionary government and their interest in the occult seems to stem from a long history of Chaos Magic and occult studies by psychological warfare officers, as well as an influx of psywar practitioners that studied the CCRU and extracted learnings from their schizo rants for control of a population through memetic virus, psychogenic epidemic, and physical thought measurement and mind control through things such as Ultrasound and Optogenetics.
