# Daily Devices

## Mindpods
The basic device. Mindpods take EEG waves and translate them into thought logs. They also work as basic headphones, and you can make phone calls with them. You can also chat with your AI assistant.

## Neuro-Crown
Bigger than the mindpods. Can use ultrasonic to help optomize brain performance, and allegedly gets better measurements than the mindpods. Commonly used by people while working.

## Phones
Some people still use phones, although they are being phased out. Phones oftentimes function more as a base for computation. Many phones are old, and during the war it was very hard to get ahold of new hardware.

## Pebble
If you want to ditch the phone, you can use a 'pebble' to host your personal compute. Pebble will try to do as much computation locally. During the war compute became scarce, so a device that optimized/ limited the use of AI tokens was very important

## Smart Watch
These watches can display a lot of information, but their most important role is usually in navigation, and collecting biometric data

## Smart Glasses (AR/XR)
Even though compute was scarce in the war, as was hardware, AR/XR technology pushed forward. Luxury SmartGlasses are the new status symbol, and are highly sought after.

## VR Headset
Enter the matrix! These are highly desired and optimized headsets for full virtual reality. They've come a long way since the first heavy VR headsets.
